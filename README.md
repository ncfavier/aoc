This repository contains my Haskell solutions for some of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges:

- 2018 days 1, 2, 25
- 2019
- 2020 (in progress)

I usually hang around in [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/)'s `##adventofcode`, `##adventofcode-help`, `##adventofcode-spoilers` and `#haskell` channels during December, as **nf**.

Also check out [glguy](https://github.com/glguy?tab=repositories&q=advent&type=source)'s, [jle](https://github.com/mstksg/advent-of-code-2020)'s, [nshepperd](https://github.com/nshepperd/advent-of-code/)'s and [nerdypepper](https://git.peppe.rs/fun/aoc/tree/)'s solutions.
